        <div class="faq-answer">
          The website is designed such that all the data entered is backed up in
          the form of an expense table. As long as the user logs in to his
          account, he/she can view the expenses entered previously.

          2. Where can I check my individual expenses on the Financial Tracker?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Once an expense is entered in the tracker, it gets automatically
          stored in the expense table. It can further be edited or deleted as
          per the user's request. This feature has been added to allow the user
          to view and analyze all his daily expenses individually.

          3. Do I have link my bank account with the website??
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          That won't be needed as we don't deal with online as well as physical
          transactions. This website is solely for the purpose of tracking the
          users' expenses to help them get an idea of their spendings and
          savings which will enable them to get a better overview of how to
          manage their budget.

        <div class="faq-question">4. How secure is the Financial Tracker?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Financial Tracker is secure to use as each user has their own
          credentials to log into their accounts that are authenticated.
          Moreover, no bank information is needed to use Financial Tracker.

          5. Does the expense table reset everyday?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Financial Tracker is a record or history of all the user's previous
          expenses. Hence, the previous day's data will not be erased. The
          current data entered by the user will just be added to the table. This
          allows the users to look back and scrutinize their expenses and work
          on their savings.
