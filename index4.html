        The idea of tracking your expenses can feel overwhelming, especially if you’ve been avoiding it for a while or have never done it before. 
        But once you get started really looking at your budget and finances, you’ll feel a sense of relief and control. 
        Finally getting on top of your money and debts comes with huge pay offs: peace of mind and no more debts!
    </p>
    <p class="two"> 
        When it comes to tracking your spending, there can be different reasons for doing it.
         Maybe you’re curious about where your money is going, are working towards a specific goal, or want to deal with your debt once and for all. 
         Whatever your reasons, we’ve got the tools and resources to help you get started.
     </p>   
   <p class="three"> 
        Whether this is your first time tracking your expenses or you’re getting back to it because your situation has changed, 
        our expense calculator and budget tracker are designed to make things simple for you.
    </p>
    <p class="four">
        Tracking where your money is going is the process of writing down what you spend. 
        You may use a little notebook to do this, a spreadsheet, an app on your phone or tablet, or other software programs. 
        You can track as you spend money or you collect receipts and track at the end of the day or week. However you do it,
        your goal is to see what you’re spending money on so that you can figure out how to spend it more wisely.
    </p>
    <p class="five">
        Tracking your expenses isn’t meant to make you feel guilty and stop you from spending.
        Rather, it’s meant to highlight what your habits are so that you can make some choices and changes later.
